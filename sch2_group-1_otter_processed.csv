1,Discussing and writing across allpossible areas should be gonedoesn't matter really? Okay.
2,"I think we have to speak in English because they're not the rules will be in English anyway. Okay,the rules, list of rules, rules,determine assignments. We have to do it now.Let's do something. English. Okay.We'll try very hard okay. We can just start with some ideas in the rough round some"
3,"numbers.So, maybe"
4,"Is there another way to do it?You have the allergens and how the body reacts like the cells, I guess they can do it as a simulation or something. No, I think maybe,but should the rules be like positive or negative or how does itwork in chairs? I guess so. Yeah.America."
5,"RSA like, measures that so that they don't get into the wild, like know how to say that in a short snappy way."
6,"all the sprayer control here.You can write it. It's just rough notes for the factory.like to just isolate the fields when you're testing a new GMO crop, why not"
7,"And also like when growing plants the probe they have to check what the location for the gym like, if it's acceptable to grow GMOs in that location. Maybe.Because, like,like, acceptable how,"
8,"Like what is a location that isn'tokay? Like,like that's where you would grow them naturally. I don't know if you go to filters or not. You have to own a field to grow something"
9,"test spreads.So something about animals, animals can't be allowed itwas that like, we only have plants"
10,"Yeah, yeah, but I don't know. But most don't get access to the plants because it might be harmful tocheck, check, check. GMOs can be animal to animalprotection from wildlife. Likeif you're growing somethinglike for human consumption section of wildlife ah"
11,"chocolate dogsthat kind of stuff.Yeah, okay.Creepy impatient. Make sure dogs chocolate.Also good."
12,Make sure it's super weed doesn't grow.Avoid the growing super weeds. That's whyyou isolate the fields.Avoid super weedsdeveloping that's the wordma'am. That's the main thing.
13,"I was trying to think what the otherYes.Yeah, I should probablyalreadyriskslike allergic reactions, mutations within unnecessary animals or somethingunnecessary animals"
14,an animal eats a GMO on the animallimitation. Maybe we can test whether GMO can affect the animal who needs it. So the humanthat's why we need protection of wildlife.wildlife in the human running
15,"Yeah, cuz Isn't that like the whole problem is that they don't really knowwhat they do. I don't know if you could test it some other way, except for animal testing or human testing,and contest and humanskind of out. But how did they test theGMO crops that are already in use? I think they use like cells and simulations through computers. Or you have to like ask the person if he or she is willing to participate in"
16,"Yeah, that's a good point.They want to participate in they say yes.Yes, but they said yes.Human testing, yes. Human testing with the consent of them."
17,"You don't go feedingthem without them.homeless people you'll be famous ifthey don't have anything to offer Really? Well, humanhuman testing is actually a pretty good way to make money without doing anything. Yes participate you eat some stuff that potentially kills you."
18,because like you can't do anything about it anyway. That's that'swhat can be anothersomething about exploitingyou. Maybe like
19,"Okay. Oh,yeah, no monoculture monoculture look asa monoculture, right. They only growone thing like, you know, so it reduces biodiversity."
20,"Actually the probably not so much money to stop it like no one and empower.Bernie will do it. Maybe limiting the amount ofGMOs allowed to be sold in the stores. Why?Well, if you don't, then the third thing is GMO. And if you don't want to"
21,"buy and there is only the GMOGMOsthey haveallergic reactions being toxicand hypotheticalmedicine when you buy in the pharmacy, there is a risk of you doing something, but it's okay. Yes.I mean, I think if there were great risks,"
22,"the information from leaking from the earth is flat.Yeah. Well, the people who actually GMOs died.They can no there's no one to tell the story. No great showsomething about environmental conservation."
23,"protection of wildlife. Yeah, it's true. I don't really know.specifics.I guess it's Yeah, it all goes into the protection of wildlife and wildlife spreading.He's also acruiser, GM.Yes, yes. Sure."
24,"resistant to pesticides and what are the pests gonna eatmore pestslike evolution, you know, they're gonna develop soyou're gonna know how to develop their smallthen the whole point is that you don't have pests."
25,"they can eat something.Was it was it called herbicide? Like first, like thanks so besides"
26,"like whatever two weeksago history, right. Liketaxes i don't know they wouldn't do this make your taxes.A vegan. Yes, as we discussed I like big company. Take advantage of GMOs but I don't really remember what the connections are we"
27,"taking advantage of GMOs is the point of GMO.Yeah. Good point. No, that was something sure there was somethingbecause also if you growgenetically modified crops take up huge amounts of space and small company. That's true now."
28,"companies don't take advantage of GMOs.Yes, we can write out the rules that We have an actual rule and then maybe while we're doing that, we'll come up with something new."
29,"GMO products need to be labeled as such.Should they also have like the riskslike you know how they saymedication,but that can be a different route."
30,unless the risks of the GMOs and the products yeahspeakfor Hoping by both.
31,
32,"human testing, but then do we say no animal testing?So we can test.Exactly. I can't give consentthat you can they'll just wave their tail to Yes."
33,spread into wild spreadingGMOs. This could be like the main point and then on the protection of the isolation.
34,"basically, friends tothe world for the limitedGMOs, GMO plants, GMO, GMO crops, crops.This is only about cancer."
35,the one we see controlled and that seems like there's a bit of like a little bit of spread into the world should we do likelimitedthat also kind of
36,"prevented, spread the spread,you can be credited.I don't think it's different color anyway, so itdoesn't matter.Though it's a different shade of blue. Ithink that's so annoying.Oh, maybe now.All GMO crops mostly grown in that area."
37,"Proven for the spread also not only the ingestion, like you have to grow them somewhere isolated before you grow them. LikeYeah, just to know how it spreads or somethinglike the spread of the plant GMO plants to be tested before,supplanted in an uncontrolled environment"
38,
39,it is necessary.Since I have a license already.detection ofthe effect of
40,"like how GMO plants affect other plants, but I guess it's the super weird thingalready belike what the GMO plants can affect the normal crops thatare growing around them.So GMOs on non GMOs must protest this Your"
41,"she we only have like, Max five rules."
42,to think again?I guess we can just like herewere the one that the effect of GMOs in London or most yeah
43,"Yes.Yes, thank you.Jews have brackets though. I feel like they don'thave breakfast today."
44,"It's just a list of rules. Yep.Did you pay list everything from? You know, the animals. All right. So how could I forget about the animals Exactly.Also the preserve non GMO plants and animalsright goes into here.It's preserving as I think here, maybe Yeah."
45,"like, it's so vague, like, how do you do that? Which was the preserve of non GMO plants?Like, that's, yeah, it sounds like something that a bigger institution needs to do.Like the country.Do like,Don't endanger non GMO plants. Then that kind of goes with 4.1."
46,"we can say that you have to, like terminate, growing your crops if something happens. Oh, that's a good idea. Yeah.Oh, yeah. But it can be a different point. It can be the fifth point as a great friend.Or last point,but doesn't matter which point it is."
47,512 as well like 5.1because the main point will probably probably be like protect the wildlife from and then the
48,Yeah. Okay must be isolated from wild animalsknow we can have a liston case Goodluck if non GMM
49,"cultivation of the crop has to be germinating in the following casesthat texturenon GMOcrops, but it's also just like normal non GMO plants, right? Yeah, not just on the environment,but on the surroundingenvironment."
50,
51,superwave this isin the following cases super super weed is detected.detectedin the brackets Why shouldn't be
52,"supermeet one, just one,only one there needs to be.You can also superweedsthe program. Super wait isn't this before as well. We understate the stage we are who we are. We don't have we sweets. So weuse a weight if you're talking about kind of this"
53,interesting side effects.We havea good idea for control that these rules are usedto government best guess.
54,"neutral, Chris Smith saw check it out coming Okay, so"
55,"aka solidgovernment agriculture ministry of theMinistry of Environment,agriculture, Agriculture Minister of"
56,Hello my name is Mr.Clementsthree minutesjust put government
57,"a five foot one is a bit moreor four point tothe fifth point is unnecessary thing. Yeah,let's see if"
58,"4.1or like the sixth point already contains on a house butyeah, soyeah, sure. Do we need to dosomething going to go on foot?Oh, we can put animals here tonon GMO"
59,that goes back to animal testing dozenanimals must be tested.We'll do animal testing. That's fine.That's fine. That's fine with their consent.Like we don't have to establish testing. Sure.Let's be ignorant. And there are already laws we don't need.
60,"The Ministry of Agriculture and environment will invent our own ministrybreaking of the rules, results in death penalty by animalswill throw you to cockroaches.milliliters should go Jesus Big Boy"
61,"and tasks into the ministrythe cultures are thinking English,"
62,responsible forthesomething somethingwhat's the word
63,will be something something bythe following ofthrough somethingfollowinganother good word
64,"let's put just by words and let it be therewill be surethat's a good wordcompliance With the rules, that sounds like"
65,"Everyone arethe farmers.The people are growing. Who are also?Yes,yes, sure it"
66,Say everyone
67,"supervisor? You do checkups and employees check at leastcockroachesnowadaysin normal agriculture, that's how they are. Company.Lets me likeI said this is my design compliance. Yes.That's a good following"
68,"Okay, it can be fulfilling, fulfillingone sentence. We don't have a wordin the sentence, to be a wordis the day to me"
69,"unless of fulfilling your laws you should be doing see this country. Okay.Thanks. I'm interested inrespecting the rulesconforming to the rules or binding rules.But to be a game up,"
