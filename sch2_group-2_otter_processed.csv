1,"Do you understand what you should be discussing and writingacross all possible areas?In your mind, but don'tgo one by one purple"
2,to speak in English youlike
3,"we connected to a pear orchardOh, how did you do that? Wait, oh, you can see which one I meanblue horse Which one? There are two blueslighterswhich experience kind of the same color."
4,"think it's that rightto write something is that youwere to the chat or on the chator your identity. There is a chat.Okay, that explains it.Okay, now enough to know"
5,"rules.Make sure to have numbers right. Okay, yes,we have to have rough notes. No.Everyone think of one ruleI have my rope.Okay, let's make something that food should be labeled. Control. Yes."
6,I just realized that I could Problem change from
7,"work. How about like, no animals can be harmed in this process.The process likegenetically modifiedfor agriculture. No, no,no, no, no, no No much."
8,"Okay, nevermind. I'll take my emotion back.Just as good maybe.No, it's not. It's really stupid. No, okay. I was about to ask if it's generic. genetically modified food then. Then so let's see. Let's say you kind of"
9,How to word it correctly? Yeah.
10,"if you have a cow, and then you're like, does this also like kind oflike animals? Yeah,sure, but we're talking about like food and crops. So thingscan get spit out there getyour fingers to like kill the cat later on. So they're having their stuffed animals."
11,that's so much better than Yeah.That sounded wrong.Like me. I likewhere are you going?
12,"you can do it here so the noiseelse honestly.Okay, let's proceed tointeresting what elsedo you got twotwo manuals. They're both goodyeah Like,"
13,"like one of the plantsand trauma is what if we say like, if you have a really common genetically modified fruit and vegetable print whatever content can be like higher This is a certainamount of grams. For example, if you have a passage of genetically modified strawberries then you can have more pictograms. Whereas if the organic, non genetically modified"
14,way to let's just put a big number up Stay with
15,let's just assume that we have a limitsales intuitionwhy the future is
16,transit fare have to be tested.So little So
17,"because I changed the number to vote.Anyway, that off"
18,my kidspotential health risksto prevent potential risks to health environment
19,they thought that I was just going to lookat them but thensome that were there then it was like oh my gosh yeah
20,"so likeso like kind of like a warning label on it so saying that this is still me this is this is still like this is still like it we're still testing it you know when I get my points So, yeah, so"
21,"to jewel studies. So like a long term effect. Yes, sir. Let's say that I'm wrong.So, studies about"
22,genetic GM productsundergoing testing must be clearly labeled or something like that.I think I have to right thank you
23,bro lectures isa specific location and it damages the world
24,know very very little aboutyourself sort of if you'regoing to reachall farm angry notice all agriculture notice
25,oil out of oil. So they should take one of theIt smells really doesn't smell good and
26,"just like a specific right? Just likethere are these kinds of goods, the seeds that you can make oil out of and they basically they are the ones They're really going to show you their genetically modified so they're kind of bad for the bees. There is something recorded that"
27,I guess it's kind of similar to the database question mark today. Yeah sure if the leaves were dusted with this genetically modified pollenbasically the butterflies that ate the leaves died.
28,"in the question waswho we're talking about the so basically that is not the Trump's may not only be harmful for the soil, but also for the entire ecosystem.Soyou're right. Yeah, so maybe I should try"
29,well I guess if you're limiting the amount of crops it kind of defeats the purpose. Just kind oftestingsay could be that maybe there have to be something to keep the bees butterflies and takes whatever away from those crops.
30,"a sign you can't pull the entire thing fueledjust greenhouses. Soyes, like the parasol like stuff, so stuff living in them might still be a better findinggood for green.So basically, again, we come back to testing that effect. The ecosystem."
31,"So anyone to foreland crops reach the market, but before the farmer is allowed to grow them, there must be substantialmust be substantial evidence that thegenetically modified crops will do no damage to the ecosystem."
32,taker system next negatively
33,
34,"to be more like less expensive race.Because right now that's the point. ganic is more intense. Yes.So there shouldn't be taxes on it. I guess If you want to, so"
35,"it should be, first of all control like, really actually control because otherwise you could mark it in us, you know, anythingyou controlis a control. They said controlstealing gallerieswho had an idea beforethey should control. So we're talking about the pricesand limiting"
36,"You know, the bigger growers and more system, right? If it'sregular tests on all yourproducts, produce, it doesn't say it's GMO. Connection"
37,producers to guide them makes moviescompanies produce all companies
38,"gM products but it'snot only GM products it's also organic because we have to test them to see that it's actually not secretly GM. Oh,you're saying all companies with like mixed facilities are you just saying likethe company is producing okaygood and you know beneficial their reception"
39,"that but since I'm a licensedproducerThe sooner youare like, let's let's see quarterly.Okay, now"
40,or how do we controlmake sure that our products are cheaper and organic.Again being produced to lower costs Just makes no sense
41,system hasto work Texas than concrete its many
42,"organicshould be more or less equal and mustexceed the price Yannick produced how to make choices you have toknow we want to exceed Okay, let's see. We'll talk about the taxes first, I guess. Should there"
43,"Exactly. on everything genetically modified, I guess.But then the revenue should go to the farmer to go tothe governor'sguide to crush it for another day.So"
44,it's kind of defeats the purpose of growing GM crops. Because growing them is cheaper.If we have taxes on them then yeah.So people should have the choice. Yes.
45,"still be taxes, insurancetaxes, even the playing field.Yeah. How much those are like what, how, how much to charge?This person? Yes.So wouldyou like person to Texas should we charge charge?"
46,I have no idea how much cheaper they would actually be10%or too much 10% 10%
47,"because they're already paying20% 20% is already on everything. Yeah, like when you pay the cashier so sooner 40% less like a 38Yes, it's fine. So extratax and"
48,have to say
49,maybe a city maybe just governmentto the local governmentI will know I've worked localsurrounding
50,"So when we sayour company is producing food, muscle our produce be tested quarterly.By by government, official fightby the government within agriculture division oflabor Local Government"
51,We have in motion
52,"Oh, I shouldsay like we should say something not price then"
53,"like that it should be kind of similar to organic produce.We already have 10% and maybe even an old kind of because we can tell them you know, we can tell them to like just have a higher price on their burgers. I mean yesbang on at the supermarket for example, it would be cheaper. It just because you would pay 10%like after the price, you know, they wouldn't be together"
54,"that was my question. Where are we charging 10% recharging are people buying or like the supermarket would love revenue from thesupermarket?Yeah, so the question is what10% extra be included in the price for a vegetable, whatever or would it be charged after So meaning out this report, if you were gonna pay for anything, then it would be actually 10% cheaper than it"
55,
56,Like we'll just do the 10%just mention it becauseI'll finish
57,"you're fine, you're fine. Yeah, okay,fine, no anylonger would actually be more greener"
58,for thesupermarkets that get all this revenue right
59,"the farmersfor farmers are just trying to the farmers are not created that they're using.I think it should be the peopleeven the prices so then you would have an option and everybody's happy. All right,just to kind of rule but we should not tell the people that just 10% x toxin"
60,"Yes. Okay.Yo boy Okay,"
61,He is my favorite numbers just stick with thosenumbersdetermine How's it possible to have favoritesnumber some numbers you another least favorite.LikeI don't even havethe number three.
62,"every every number to do with eight818 8830 minus 20.And for a long time, I was so superstitious about it that I tried to do everything in multiples of 12. So like, I don't know, why not just take a walk and walk for 1224 or 36 It's not like hating in between"
63,"my most favorite plane ticket ever that I've had was because I was flying to Helsinki and the flight number was666666to zero flown in a plane, which is the flight back to the 13th Friday and we're sitting on the seat 13 I would get off"
64,you know it's gonnastay empty anyway. So why don't we just go from 12 to 1314that's that will totally be me if I was designing a plane
65,or two plus two is not four.So now can we do this thing?I don't know. I think I don't know. I
