Let’s imagine that you are a cell. You’ve just been given a big, juicy glucose molecule, and you’d like to convert some of the energy in this glucose molecule into a more usable form, one that you can use to power your metabolic reactions. How can you go about this? What’s the best way for you to squeeze as much energy as possible out of that glucose molecule, and to capture this energy in a handy form?
Fortunately for us, our cells – and those of other living organisms – are excellent at harvesting energy from glucose and other organic molecules, such as fats and amino acids. Here, we’ll get a high-level overview of how cells break down fuels. Then, we'll take a closer look at some of the electron transfer reactions (redox reactions) that are key to this process.
Overview of fuel breakdown pathways
The reactions that extract energy from molecules like glucose are called catabolic reactions. That means they involve breaking a larger molecule into smaller pieces. For example, when glucose is broken down in the presence of oxygen, it’s converted into six carbon dioxide molecules and six water molecules. The overall reaction for this process can be written as:

    C6H12O6\text C_6\text H_{12} \text O_6C6​H12​O6​start text, C, end text, start subscript, 6, end subscript, start text, H, end text, start subscript, 12, end subscript, start text, O, end text, start subscript, 6, end subscript + 6O26\text O_26O2​6, start text, O, end text, start subscript, 2, end subscript →\rightarrow→right arrow 6CO26\text{CO}_26CO2​6, start text, C, O, end text, start subscript, 2, end subscript + 6H2O6\text H_2\text O6H2​O6, start text, H, end text, start subscript, 2, end subscript, start text, O, end text ΔG=−686 kcal/mol\quad\quad\quad\Delta G = -686 \: \text {kcal/mol}ΔG=−686kcal/moldelta, G, equals, minus, 686, start text, k, c, a, l, slash, m, o, l, end text

In a cell, this overall reaction is broken down into many smaller steps. Energy contained in the bonds of glucose is released in small bursts, and some of it is captured in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a small molecule that powers reactions in the cell. Much of the energy from glucose is dissipated as heat, but enough is captured to keep the metabolism of the cell running.

As a glucose molecule is gradually broken down, some of the breakdowns steps release energy that is captured directly as ATP. In these steps, a phosphate group is transferred from a pathway intermediate straight to ADP, a process known as substrate-level phosphorylation.
Many more steps, however, produce ATP in an indirect way. In these steps, electrons from glucose are transferred to small molecules known as electron carriers. The electron carriers take the electrons to a group of proteins in the inner membrane of the mitochondrion, called the electron transport chain. As electrons move through the electron transport chain, they go from a higher to a lower energy level and are ultimately passed to oxygen (forming water).
As an electron passes through the electron transport chain, the energy it releases is used to pump protons (H+\text H^+H+start text, H, end text, start superscript, plus, end superscript) out of the matrix of the mitochondrion, forming an electrochemical gradient. When the H+\text H^+H+start text, H, end text, start superscript, plus, end superscript flow back down their gradient, they pass through an enzyme called ATP synthase, driving synthesis of ATP. This process is known as oxidative phosphorylation. The diagram below shows examples of oxidative and substrate-level phosphorylation.

Inside the matrix of the mitochondrion, substrate-level phosphorylation takes place when a phosphate group from an intermediate of the glucose breakdown reactions is transferred to ADP, forming ATP. At the same time, electrons are transported from intermediates of the glucose breakdown reactions to the electron transport chain by electron carriers. The electrons move through the electron transport chain, pumping protons into the intermembrane space. When these protons flow back down their concentration gradient, they pass through ATP synthase, which uses the electron flow to synthesize ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate (Pi). This process of electron transport, proton pumping, and capture of energy from the proton gradient to make ATP is called oxidative phosphorylation.

[Is that really what a mitochondrion looks like?]
When organic fuels like glucose are broken down using an electron transport chain, the breakdown process is known as cellular respiration.
Electron carriers
Electron carriers, also called electron shuttles, are small organic molecules that play key roles in cellular respiration. Their name is a good description of their job: they pick up electrons from one molecule and drop them off with another. You can see an electron carrier shuttling electrons from the glucose breakdown reactions to the electron transport chain in the diagram above.
There are two types of electron carriers that are particularly important in cellular respiration: NAD+^++start superscript, plus, end superscript (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, shown below) and FAD (flavin adenine dinucleotide).
Chemical structures of NAD+ and NADH. NADH has a hydrogen attached to one nitrogen-containing ring, whereas in NAD+ this same ring lacks a hydrogen and has a positive charge.

When NAD+^++start superscript, plus, end superscript and FAD pick up electrons, they also gain one or more hydrogen atoms, switching to a slightly different form:

    FAD\text{\green{FAD}}FADstart text, start color #28ae7b, F, A, D, end color #28ae7b, end text +++plus 2e−2\text {e}^-2e−2, start text, e, end text, start superscript, minus, end superscript +++plus 2 H+2 \text{\purple{ H}}^+2 H+2, start text, start color #9d38bd, space, H, end color #9d38bd, end text, start superscript, plus, end superscript →\rightarrow→right arrow FADH2\text{\green{FAD}\purple{H}}_\purple 2FADH2​start text, start color #28ae7b, F, A, D, end color #28ae7b, start color #9d38bd, H, end color #9d38bd, end text, start subscript, start color #9d38bd, 2, end color #9d38bd, end subscript

And when they drop electrons off, they go neatly back to their original form:

    NAD\text{\blue{NAD}}NADstart text, start color #6495ed, N, A, D, end color #6495ed, end textH\text{\purple{H}}Hstart text, start color #9d38bd, H, end color #9d38bd, end text →\rightarrow→right arrow NAD+\text{\blue{NAD}}^+NAD+start text, start color #6495ed, N, A, D, end color #6495ed, end text, start superscript, plus, end superscript +++plus 2e−2\text {e}^-2e−2, start text, e, end text, start superscript, minus, end superscript +++plus H+\text {\purple{H}}^+H+start text, start color #9d38bd, H, end color #9d38bd, end text, start superscript, plus, end superscript

    FADH2\text{\green{FAD}\purple{H}}_\purple 2FADH2​start text, start color #28ae7b, F, A, D, end color #28ae7b, start color #9d38bd, H, end color #9d38bd, end text, start subscript, start color #9d38bd, 2, end color #9d38bd, end subscript →\rightarrow→right arrow FAD\text{\green{FAD}}FADstart text, start color #28ae7b, F, A, D, end color #28ae7b, end text +++plus 2e−2\text {e}^-2e−2, start text, e, end text, start superscript, minus, end superscript +++plus 2 H+2 \text{\purple{ H}}^+2 H+2, start text, start color #9d38bd, space, H, end color #9d38bd, end text, start superscript, plus, end superscript 

The reactions in which NAD+^++start superscript, plus, end superscript and FAD gain or lose electrons are examples of a class of reactions called redox reactions. Let's take a closer look at what these reactions are and why they're so important in cellular respiration.
Redox reactions: What are they?
Cellular respiration involves many reactions in which electrons are passed from one molecule to another. Reactions involving electron transfers are known as oxidation-reduction reactions (or redox reactions).
You may have learned in chemistry that a redox reaction is when one molecule loses electrons and is oxidized, while another molecule gains electrons (the ones lost by the first molecule) and is reduced. Handy mnemonic: “LEO goes GER”: Lose Electrons, Oxidized; Gain Electrons, Reduced.
The formation of magnesium chloride is one example of a redox reaction that nicely matches our definition above:

    Mg+Cl2→Mg2++2Cl−\text {Mg} + \text {Cl}_2 \rightarrow \text {Mg}^{2+} + 2 \text {Cl}^-Mg+Cl2​→Mg2++2Cl−start text, M, g, end text, plus, start text, C, l, end text, start subscript, 2, end subscript, right arrow, start text, M, g, end text, start superscript, 2, plus, end superscript, plus, 2, start text, C, l, end text, start superscript, minus, end superscript

In this reaction, the magnesium atom loses two electrons, so it is oxidized. These two electrons are accepted by chlorine, which is reduced.
However, as Sal points out in his video on oxidation and reduction in biology, we should really put quotes around "gains electrons" and "loses electrons" in our description of what happens to molecules in a redox reaction. That's because we can also have a reaction in which one molecule hogs electrons rather than fully gaining them or is hogged from rather than fully losing them.
What do we mean by that? To illustrate, let's use the example from Sal's video:

    2222H2\text{H}_2H2​start text, H, end text, start subscript, 2, end subscript +++plus O2\text{O}_2O2​start text, O, end text, start subscript, 2, end subscript →\rightarrow→right arrow 2222H2O\text{H}_2\text{O}H2​Ostart text, H, end text, start subscript, 2, end subscript, start text, O, end text +++plus heat\text{heat}heatstart text, h, e, a, t, end text

This reaction does not involve an obvious electron transfer, but it's still an example of a redox reaction. That's because the amount of electron density on the H\text HHstart text, H, end text and O\text OOstart text, O, end text atoms is different in the products than in the reactants.
Why that's true is not obvious, so let's break it down using the properties of atoms. When H\text HHstart text, H, end text atoms are bonded to each other in H2\text H_2H2​start text, H, end text, start subscript, 2, end subscript, they share electrons equally: neither can win the tug-of-war for the electrons. The same is true for O\text OOstart text, O, end text atoms bonded to each other in O2\text O_2O2​start text, O, end text, start subscript, 2, end subscript. However, the situation is different in the product, H2O\text H_2\text OH2​Ostart text, H, end text, start subscript, 2, end subscript, start text, O, end text. Oxygen is much more electronegative, or electron-hungry, than hydrogen, so in an O−H\text O-\text HO−Hstart text, O, end text, minus, start text, H, end text bond in a water molecule, the electrons will be hogged by the O\text OOstart text, O, end text atom and spend more time close to it than to the H\text HHstart text, H, end text.
So, even though no electrons were fully gained or lost in the above reaction:

    O\text OOstart text, O, end text has more electron density after the reaction than before (was reduced)
    H\text HHstart text, H, end text has less electron density than it did before (was oxidized)

For you chemistry buffs out there, this change in electron hogging during the reaction can be more precisely described as a change in oxidation states of the O\text OOstart text, O, end text and H\text HHstart text, H, end text atoms. Check out Sal's video to see how oxidation states can be used as "bookkeeping tools" to represent shifts in electron sharing.
What about gaining and losing H\text{H}Hstart text, H, end text and O\text OOstart text, O, end text atoms?
Oxidation and reduction reactions are fundamentally about the transfer and/or hogging of electrons. However, in the context of biology, there is a little trick we can often use to figure out where the electrons are going. This trick lets us use the gain or loss of H\text HHstart text, H, end text and O\text OOstart text, O, end text atoms as a proxy for the transfer of electrons.
In general:

    If a carbon-containing molecule gains H\text HHstart text, H, end text atoms or loses O\text OOstart text, O, end text atoms during a reaction, it’s likely been reduced (gained electrons or electron density)
    On the other hand, if a carbon-containing molecule loses H\text HHstart text, H, end text atoms or gains O\text OOstart text, O, end text atoms, it’s probably been oxidized (lost electrons or electron density)

For example, let’s go back to the reaction for glucose breakdown:

    C6H12O6\text C_6\text H_{12} \text O_6C6​H12​O6​start text, C, end text, start subscript, 6, end subscript, start text, H, end text, start subscript, 12, end subscript, start text, O, end text, start subscript, 6, end subscript + 6O26\text O_26O2​6, start text, O, end text, start subscript, 2, end subscript →\rightarrow→right arrow 6CO26\text{CO}_26CO2​6, start text, C, O, end text, start subscript, 2, end subscript + 6H2O6\text H_2\text O6H2​O6, start text, H, end text, start subscript, 2, end subscript, start text, O, end text

In glucose, carbon is associated with H\text HHstart text, H, end text atoms, while in carbon dioxide, it is not associated with any H\text HHstart text, H, end texts. So, we would predict that glucose is oxidized in this reaction. Similarly, the O\text OOstart text, O, end text atoms in O2\text O_2O2​start text, O, end text, start subscript, 2, end subscript end up being associated with more H\text HHstart text, H, end texts after the reaction than before, so we would predict that oxygen is reduced. (Sal confirms this from an electron transfer perspective in his video on redox reactions in respiration.)
Why does this trick work? Here is one way you can think about it, from Sal's video on oxidation and reduction in biology:

    The atoms that H\text HHstart text, H, end text is usually bound to in organic molecules, such as C, O, N,\text {C, O, N,}C, O, N,start text, C, comma, space, O, comma, space, N, comma, end text and P,\text P,P,start text, P, end text, comma are more electronegative than H\text HHstart text, H, end text itself. So, if a H\text HHstart text, H, end text atom and its electron join a molecule, odds are that whatever's bonded to the new H\text{H}Hstart text, H, end text is going to hog the electron and become reduced.
    O\text OOstart text, O, end text is more electronegative than any of the other major atoms found commonly in biological molecules. If it joins a molecule, it's likely going to pull away electron density from whatever it's attached to, oxidizing it.

What's the point of all this redox?
Now that we have a better sense of what a redox reaction is, let's spend a moment thinking about the why. Why does a cell go to the trouble of ripping electrons off of glucose, transferring them to electron carriers, and passing them through an electron transport chain in a long series of redox reactions?
The basic answer is: to get energy out of that glucose molecule! Here is the glucose breakdown reaction we saw at the beginning of the article:

    C6H12O6\text C_6\text H_{12} \text O_6C6​H12​O6​start text, C, end text, start subscript, 6, end subscript, start text, H, end text, start subscript, 12, end subscript, start text, O, end text, start subscript, 6, end subscript + 6O26\text O_26O2​6, start text, O, end text, start subscript, 2, end subscript →\rightarrow→right arrow 6CO26\text{CO}_26CO2​6, start text, C, O, end text, start subscript, 2, end subscript + 6H2O6\text H_2\text O6H2​O6, start text, H, end text, start subscript, 2, end subscript, start text, O, end text ΔG=−686 kcal/mol\quad\quad\quadΔG = -686 \: \text {kcal/mol}ΔG=−686kcal/molΔ, G, equals, minus, 686, start text, k, c, a, l, slash, m, o, l, end text

Which we can rewrite a bit more clearly as:

    C6H12O6\text C_6\text H_{12} \text O_6C6​H12​O6​start text, C, end text, start subscript, 6, end subscript, start text, H, end text, start subscript, 12, end subscript, start text, O, end text, start subscript, 6, end subscript + 6O26\text O_26O2​6, start text, O, end text, start subscript, 2, end subscript →\rightarrow→right arrow 6CO26\text{CO}_26CO2​6, start text, C, O, end text, start subscript, 2, end subscript + 6H2O6\text H_2\text O6H2​O6, start text, H, end text, start subscript, 2, end subscript, start text, O, end text + energy!\text{energy!}energy!start text, e, n, e, r, g, y, !, end text

As Sal explains in his video on redox reactions in respiration, electrons are at a higher energy level when they are associated with less electronegative atoms (such as C\text CCstart text, C, end text or H\text HHstart text, H, end text) and at a lower energy level when they are associated with a more electronegative atom (such as O\text OOstart text, O, end text). So, in a reaction like the breakdown of glucose above, energy is released because the electrons are moving to a lower-energy, more "comfortable" state as they travel from glucose to oxygen.
The energy that's released as electrons move to a lower-energy state can be captured and used to do work. In cellular respiration, electrons from glucose move gradually through the electron transport chain towards oxygen, passing to lower and lower energy states and releasing energy at each step. The goal of cellular respiration is to capture this energy in the form of ATP.
