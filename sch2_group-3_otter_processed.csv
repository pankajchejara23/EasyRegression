1,"What you should be discussing and writing out all possible areasonline to your mind, but don't just go one by one.Yeah, we cantalk to each other discuss right?"
2,like what doyou know like what's the how does how GMOs and you know growing them affect English? How does it affect the problem health?environment like different categories? Yes. We see what what do we have to hover laws Or rule twice
3,public health but likeenvironment
4,course the environmentjust like environment synthon are like some categorieswe can the subcategories yeah for herwriting Okay.
5,"orange. Give me my theories like,"
6,"for subcategoryagriculture.I think it was under the environmentcategories, but I think it's agriculture we're going to have to, like every culture is really true what we need to talk about. But stay true to talk. Yeah, no, no, but like, that's the self topic of like"
7,"and so on.Like, you need to make sure that the farmers are okay with GMOs in their farms and you need to buy land and you know, doesn't really go into the environment. I mean, they do overlap in some areas. But I mean, yeah, now"
8,"I guess. I mean, one rule definitely can cover more than one area. So just for us tohave a clear picture of what's going on. So"
9,"There should be some, like expenses. Yeah, I'm thinking of like how much to make actual profit and how exactly I'm thinking of budget.Profit and taxesneed to benothing going on like profit seem to be. It's just that I think let's say some farmers are starting to grow GMOs and others are growing naturally. The ones who are going here most can ask a higher price for the product because it's richer in nutrition speakers fresher and so on. Then those and the people will buy it. Once you know better and cheaper actually, I think it's just I thinking that"
10,
11,Yes. Like some sort of labels like I think they actually do have those rights now.To some extent.Yes.
12,label.Shit.GMO product. My shirt.
13,has to be a boatas such
14,"productproducts by product as well. Yeah. Okay, the internet is not working.Can we do something about subsidy research quantify the government To the ones who are growing children's"
15,"People who crouching props, examples, yeah.Subsidiaries from the government, that's whyif they need to bit more money, they're more likely to buy them because they are light substitutes."
16,"I think it's like harder for them. Yeah, it creates so much more competition. Yeah.Do you thinkit's not more personalcan be countable or uncountable in more general common Do context the plural form will also be product. Thank you."
17,
18,
19,"Just thinking maybe to create equal competition on the marketplace. The GMO products should have fair prices and they should be as cheap as possible because it's cheaper to grow because you can grow more of it from the same quantities have or low producing resources. If you start the first year will be more expensive but then profit is when fee Oh, over time, yes, the only time it's more profitable. Yeah. So unless we want to completely bankrupt natural product farmers and we have two sets of costly limitations to imoh product so, yes so they caught you know, professionals how to write"
20,
21,Like how to actually grow GMOs like take chemicals and substances that are used should be like some sort of
22,"Check scientistfarmer sounds like it soundssuch soundslike the farmer and he's like, I want to grow like GMOs can't like do it himself at first and you know, sort of like I don't even know how scientist Berkeley"
23,"it disgusting top discussing topics that I don't know well enough for to make. I know. I'm not an expert on GMOs, how am I supposed to be? I know.Like the business side of it. Yeah. I would love to I don't know."
24,"scientists, right. Yeah, like, it's like we as the true like beginners who know very, very little about GMOs are trying to make rules for everyone, although they're not real and stuff, but it still is hard to discuss. If you're like, Yeah, I don't know how the marketplace works. And I'm not really sure how GMOs actually work. I don't know anything about GMO. Yeah, so I have a role and GMOs should be growing in a competitive environment. This is"
25,"you can write itmaybe you should write, like why to prevent bah bah bah bah bah or somethinggenerally should be the first"
26,"to informfind the vitamin,customer on fire officers"
27,how's it called polluting or intoxicating the surrounding environments and organisms or something like thatcan't grow to motion to not sure what the products in the same scale I guess.I hope they don't
28,"I'm sorry, my brain. Me open here"
29,"GMO product has to be clearly labeled as such to inform the customers of the potential benefits and risk of buying, supporting and consuming such product on the industry. screen. Thanks, maybe also something about testing after products before you go on to market, conducting scientific research to find out the health benefits or risks or"
30,"before selling GMOs before even like, go for distributing GMOs, the public, it has to be thorough that the benefits and risks of certain crimes test to be"
31,before the market
32,"something quite public.Yes, it doesn't work so stupid because there are so many things we could say butwe actually have one more which is the first"
33,"like, I didn't listen because Isort of Formula goes wrong, then some sort of the corrections could be increasing. What's the test?Like laboratory So, it has to be researched in a lab, they have to send it off to a lab and collaborate with the lab. Yeah, I mean, are the lab"
34,"because oh, we can put that you have to have a some kind of GMO license before selling your product. So I was like thinking, query.Selling and growing.Yes, was like, I mean, like some sort of like I think selling because if you want to grow GMOs first you must like you know way experiment or let's say your first time going to have like raisins and it should there should be like natural like database that gets there for all day farmers and everything. Like we have those for every company in Estonia where you can see like the"
35,
36,like this. Okay.Interested in My sense that it can be sold and distributed
37,"No licensesellers can only take every product has a license, like let's say I grow grow a GMO tomato, then I golike these researchers find out the benefits of this tomato like"
38,"already been tested in the lab.It looks good to me also.Not myself. I'm telling I'm going toknow what you mean. like trying to like, like, because that's a licensed seller. Yes, I will have let's say banana said are good and you know, beneficial and they're researched and you know, yeah, good, good. But then let's say or sir Growing cucumbers by myself and then it turned out to be very bad. But since I am a licensed seller, everybody has already bought them and the public has no I just consumed them."
39,"salt or vinegar, salt. Likebetween songs.I don't even know how many hearts Do you have a year? How many are just one? How much? Depends?"
40,"What's usually the spring.Yeah, trying to understand the harvest.Don't have any It's because"
41,"a rule that says GM. Ohwait, I forgot whereit started. Oh,that the main dishesrules related to regarding rules regarding GMOs should be only made by GMO experts think they're the only rule. We are not GMO experts. We cannot make the rules. That's actually a good idea. The third thing Yes."
42,How to make clauses you have to tax everything. That'sa mistake. Whenever one
43,every Texas Yes.
44,The same was brewing secret me right yeah but the whole packagecultivation okaypreserving yeahoh distribution
45,"was regarding GMOs Retta cultivation, distribution consumption?Oh, yeah. There's an M missing consumption should onlymade byGMO GMOexperts and experienced"
46,"scientists, so a scientist scientistor the government, because the government usually has, oh, yeah, because the government usually has like specialists in all fields. So they probably have like a judo expert there and if you say"
47,why does it keep doing it? Last night nine ready?Yes. I think
48,not only you control the environment like howso such you're like white
49,aboutenvironment surrounding spring
50,Thank you. Good Sunday.
51,you should learn according to Richard Spencer was
52,
53,"I think the last rule says it's all the same.Because we have suchwe have rules for everything but not specific rules.Because we are not experts, we can make a circuit board if we don't know what we're talking about second."
54,"noise and then it's kind of like nice and nice and nice. And since I made this was kind of likeyeah, there's just like, silence.A few spikes here and there because I wanted something to break that awkward silence.Like a mic drop. It's like It was so good that no one has anything else to say. Yes, it concludes everything. Yes."
55,That's what I'm saying you have organic productionrule.But the conclusion we reached when we discussed it earlier was how to make the rule like it's almost impossible or it's like
56,of silence now.
57,"go through this list.Action.Okay, I got a course that will tell you all right. Give me a call"
58,me no error professionalprofessional
