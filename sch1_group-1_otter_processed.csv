1,"mitochondrion ceo 's we need it. We need a sheet.They're gonna give us those sheets.Okay, include the weights. Can we just start working on the other ones? I guess? Well we start taking those Oh, dang it. Yeah.She's gonna see which"
2,"Oh every single one of us. So we need a fenced off we needone very good okay. Yeah so we can just start from the outline Yeah, like the outer membrane. Yeah. So let's draw the outline like a capsule. It looks"
3,"Oh, yeah, label? Yeah. Would you have to label it? Just? Yeah.It's like difficult to draw to use.You just draw something just through a scanner. Yeah.Plus there isn't like a so it's a right way to draw it. I mean, you're just"
4,"outer member. It's just like you don't know. Guys.You can just have the inner and outer matrix. Matrix.DNA. Yeah.Me. Oh, maybe we should like make the representative darker. Like fully filled in. Yeah. And the"
5,Because otherwise we'll just mess everything up. I won't be able to tell what what is what it isyou can leave right away.DNA and chromosomes 17 chromosomes 70s high but we need a scale bar. Do we do it? Here?
6,"Oh no. Tell us today.I don't even mean either but we can make like, like far away.And I'm like remembering in a memory matrix everyone We'll see but it will be in a different color."
7,"We don't have to write it intospace, remember in space.But we can see.We don't have just between the two memories,just that's more than that. We know. What do we get? It's like, instead of the scale, because it will be a bit like"
8,"We know we need the scales to meet like,No, no, no, it's one micro meter. Do you know how big the mic might have been? Because on the slides that we checked, it was like, one like micro meter, but I don't know how big the mitochondrion is.It can be bigger than let's just say the say.Let's just Draw like a line as long as"
9,"one and then just write the number there. Yeah. And then you have like, yeah. And if you want to calculate the actual size, then you have to know No, but much,much. Yeah, how to scope like this.And then you write the like the actual size, like two micro meters there. And then also one micro meter."
10,"Just draw the line and write the numbers. Plus, it's like an approximate thing we don't have. We don't have the knowledge. Oops, sorry. Is this like far away? So I don't know. Maybe learning it yesterday. Yeah.Yes, this finger is supposed to be on this side. It's like Russian shy as you So, like"
11,"She loves functions.Okay, can we each take like one so it doesn't take forever because that's the thing is recording the whole point. Like Yeah, let's talk discuss and then someone writes it.Okay, sure."
12,"isn't the most complete structure already like outer membrane. So the next thing is function.Wait, because we don't have, we don't have to explain the structure of the membrane. We have to explain its function and what that is how.Explain how each structure adapted to help maximizeexactly like how our remembering is already a structure. You"
13,"role in cellular respiration. I think that's what it means.Yes. Yeah.Wait, we just discussed like the trailer which is also its membrane, but it helps to keep to the teens. Yeah.It protects mitochondria and from the cytoplasm where it is located. So yeah.Yeah. So wants to write a strange short."
14,"Oh, I'm, I don't know what I am.I'm purple. Yeah, the whole group is purple. That's a thing.No, you know, you're pink.I'm pink. Yeah. If I'm writing something.You You have your own. No, but it looks exactly the same as this one. Yeah, but that's yours.Oh,"
15,"adopted to increase the efficiency bias? Did we talk about the functions at all, we just talked about where they are inefficient.And steps.I feel like we talked about the inner membrane, how it adapted to increase efficiency, we know that our model is a logical answer."
16,"Okay. Okay. Let it be so brief. Okay.We can endomembrane Yeah. Including cristae conditions. So the function is for where's the thing?I just don't just just, can I just start like,Where's Oh,I put it you can write it. No.I think you're lying.Yeah. What is up?"
17,"Okay, so the inner membrane repeating Krista, it'sus, Moses. Yeah,yes. Maintain approach equations.This world sname electron chainis it doing working because it's mostly because they well on no"
18,"the lights are they meant to be off?Okay.Just checking just making sure so kimia helps maintain the proton gradient of the electron transport chain. Yes, yes.To increase efficiency byits folded"
19,"Yes. And compressed which increases the surface area says yes.Oh my god, thus increasing the matrix."
20,"Yes, it can write it.Your blue Why are we the same? We're the same. We're all of it. Maybe there are different shades.Check. I'm ready to next one."
21,"I didn't know what can separate them like but yeah,yeah. Yeah.Because like that's so different.Yeah.They don't the function is different or the structure itself is different.Okay, so we're good, right? All right, the zones synthesizing. So mitochondrial DNA helps to Oh, sorry, I wanted to write it. Oh, okay. It's called a medical for some of the proteins"
22,"used inside or inside a microcontroller. So, and then, the ribosomes synthesize synthesize to produce proteins used Also inside yeah and also proteins and enzymes and enzymes you"
23,it's not a problem if we I mean extra things there synthesize proteins and enzymes utilize two sides on
24,"intermembrane space. Now,it's a separate state.Oh, I can't type Sorry, it's okay.The intermembrane speed grades in the proton, proton gradient because in is still in respiration is pumped outin the proton, proton, radiant protein membrane. Yes. Right to get written together. It's the same as a"
25,"And also it's separate, separate separates in or out rememberabout the adapted through,we can eat by now we can do that."
26,"have like eight questions here we should probably like okay, let's just move on and then we can come back if you have more time.Okay, let's do that. So electron tomography involves oxidation reduction of electron carriers at the understanding of mitochondria,the term electro tomography"
27,we can talk about in ophthalmology? Yeah?Yeah.I don't think I've ever learned. Okay.We can probably deal with it.Come up with
28,"tracks.Project progress because it's understanding of cell respiration. It turns to the last thinking so it would make sense.Yeah, just like look subtler To lower a fee yeah i don't know i was i was say let's"
29,our logyeahlet's just say like it tracks it tracks movements of electrons yeah was gonna write I can write it Wait What did I say track
30,"electrons maybe like Sure,"
31,"But yeah, I mean, I might look it up in the textbook. Oh, maybe we can just move on. Yeah.So okay, so we just have to write like what it was. So we did the exact same thing in class.So electrons in oxidation electrons are lost lost. An"
32,"How do I how do I move on? Oh, wait, I know. I can just oh, no, no, I can just put Like what? Wait, yep. I mean,you can just tap tap.Like it has the button and you can move on but anyway, right the whole text Yeah."
33,"yeah, we did it.Didn't need to eclipse the one that looks like a nucleotide. No, no. And they do"
34,in reduction and oxidizedYeah.In the middle but they are oxidized which means that the not hat's not right.
35,
36,"so do those electrons are getting them if they think when they think they are oxidized, we are losing electronsbut at the same at the same time I'm really we have any any view? Ah yeahyes. So that is like that But somewhere closer so that each was loss"
37,electron carrier the carriersare charged against one Yeah. Okay. Yeah yeah not that and yeah i mean i don't know
38,"That's the last night Oh no, I wrote Oh, sorry wait everything is For every"
39,"But there are lights drop. Over here.Yes. Wait, wait. You have different colors though look the shape or color just shorter,but it's very so are you right to do do okay?Yes, but son was one of them."
40,Okay. Yeah. Good enough. I think this is all wrong. Yes because they're in a reduction and becomes nada. Yeah and fit the goals and the reduction.I think we're good at h2 h2h3 carriers in Japan that NADH
41,"DHT Yes, yes, yes. Oh, just draw diamondhappen. Oh, one separate employee passed away. Okay. What are you doing which says for this one as well?"
42,"At least gives the names.Enjoy sugar, you can just it was. So it was heck. So it's all"
43,"in the first part where it was ribose or do you always use the DNA on a picture?Yeah. Okay, so we have six carpet sugar. Yeah.ATP is that it goes up. So then the phosphates are added."
44,"sugar objects, the phosphates from ATP become the ADP, right? Yeah.Okay, well,why is it good to ADP to other other way around now I know because ATP has Three phosphates. Yes, he has to. So"
45,"Okay, and then it goes Tony. I haven't put in my notes and then it becomes a dp.So then the two phosphates from that go to the Netherlands we have to write is that it's first fertilization the one with the with the point, but we have to use those words. We can write"
46,"words.Did you write photo that I want? First relation where the P is added. We can put like number one, I think to first fertilization, I think"
47,"yeah, yeah, so That's right. That's right. So you can put like number one is first fertilization the number two license which falls apart. Reminds me of meiosis"
48,"violation also license from photo license. Yes.wishes splittingWell, I just found out that license means flooding today."
49,"everything she says. Okay. And obviously nota dp because yes.Oxidation also.phosphorus is taken out. Yeah. oxidation. Yes. And and also something was about the NA, oh, it's formed in a"
50,"Yes, you're part of it because I wrote it there.So you use two ATP in depth for ATP. So there's a net gain of two plus eight. Yes. Yes. h2, right that probably maybe I can write it on the other side of ATP formation. So maybe we should.Okay, first ofall, sorry, you know, We talked you through but we have to check in still It has everything."
51,"Yeah, he has. Okay.I'm telling you, we should put like number one first fertilization to license three observations.Yeah. So put like, one, one, number two and number three in front of the word so that we won't be confused and everyone else won't"
52,"So wait,what did you do?I guessI guess is Last, oxidation there should be like, versus"
53,"Yeah, because you draw it out. I mean, there's a gap. So just we have to use the worst. So just write thelast one.I find cross fertilization. I find I come from it seems that I'm just like syllable"
54,"phosphorylation.Wow. Oh, it's like a relation relation. Yeah.Relation Wow.Relation between phosphorus. Amazing.Okay, so I'm gonna type itright in.Possible screw.Photo cause I don't know how state"
55,"check the ones here, like efficiency, we don't have efficiency. I can try to like what can we can make, we can do it together.It was in order to make something weaker to pass in, make low sugar itself. Make the molecule weaker or lesseasier to break down. Let's do some better word."
56,"Yes. Your bonds get weaker in the bonds with the between thecarbon carbons Yeah, I was. I was literally a molecule estivo Yes. So yeah, it says like first relation of molecules makes them less stable. Yeah.Okay, this morning molecularity What do we get this one?"
57,"listening to a two piece.What? What was the question about ? A piece ? Because we put two in, we get the same two"
58,"three observation. We need to send a T.Oh, yeah. Frankie o,t, H becomes an electron.No, that's not right. But we need ATP at na is a different things. Because Because nav is electron carrier carrier. We need an energy molecule. I feel like energy molecule would be like here where the split split is happening. It's like"
59,"where the market is Wait, are they gained or have they lost? That's the question.I think they're deemed because we're missing two ATPs yeah"
60,"more can it be let's let's think logically word can a TPP released.Its releasing Yeah. Yeah. Exactly where black break the point of where you from one sugar you get to offer higher rates. Yeah, I would say there Because we break bonds"
61,"new phosphorus you already know from the Pirate Bay.For them to become pirates,we need energy"
62,"Don't remember today, we can just throw it in the region butwe know that's missing.Trust me, I don't like at least we know that there should be four ATP is not to wait maybe we can write down liketwo like exactly what we put into two ATP or"
63,"Yeah, write it down. Write it down.Yeah, it's empty. Time.ticking into minutes. Yeah.No, no, no, but we can get from the break as well. Okay, because we need to address our payment questionnaire as well. Oh,"
64,"limit? No, I don't think so. I don't know.Wait, let's think of the efficiencies. Maybe we'll kind of come up with some of them in some places to spice up the efficiency of OSHA membrane"
